## Client Package Descriptions
### Webpack-bundle-analyze:
Visualize size of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap.
(Take a look @ bundlephobia)

### Lodash
Lodash is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks using the functional programming paradigm.

### Graphql
The JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL, a query language for APIs created by Facebook.

### Apollo-client
Apollo Client is a fully-featured caching GraphQL client with integrations for React, Angular, and more. It allows you to easily build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL.

### Apollo-cache-inmemory
apollo-cache-inmemory is the recommended cache implementation for Apollo Client 2.0. InMemoryCache is a normalized data store that supports all of Apollo Client 1.0's features without the dependency on Redux.

### Apollo-link-http
The http link is a terminating link that fetches GraphQL results from a GraphQL endpoint over an http connection.

### Query-string
Parse and stringify URL query strings. A query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a Web browser or other client application, for example as part of an HTML form

### vue-apollo
Allows you to integrate graphql with vue.js application

### vue-fragment
Fragment component for vue.js

### vue-router
Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js

### eslint
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code

### eslint-plugin-graphql
An ESLint plugin that checks tagged query strings inside JavaScript, or queries inside .graphql files, against a GraphQL schema.

### eslint-plugin-vue
This plugin allows us to check the <template> and <script> of .vue files with ESLint, as well as Vue code in .js files.

### graphql-tag
A JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL query strings into the standard GraphQL AST.

### vuetify loader
The vuetify-loader alleviates this pain by automatically importing all the Vuetify components you use, where you use them. This will also make code-splitting more effective, as webpack will only load the components required for that chunk to be displayed.

### sass-loader
Loads a SASS/SCSS file and compiles it to CSS.

### node-sass
Node-sass is a library that provides binding for Node.js to LibSass, the C version of the popular stylesheet preprocessor, Sass.
