(Take a look @ bundlephobia)

### vue-fragment
Fragment component for vue.js

### vue-router
Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js

### eslint
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code

### eslint-plugin-vue
This plugin allows us to check the <template> and <script> of .vue files with ESLint, as well as Vue code in .js files.

### vuetify loader
The vuetify-loader alleviates this pain by automatically importing all the Vuetify components you use, where you use them. This will also make code-splitting more effective, as webpack will only load the components required for that chunk to be displayed.

### sass-loader
Loads a SASS/SCSS file and compiles it to CSS.

### node-sass
Node-sass is a library that provides binding for Node.js to LibSass, the C version of the popular stylesheet preprocessor, Sass.
